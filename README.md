# python-organisms-simulation

This project was created as an assignment for Object Oriented Programming course at my university.
It's goal was to introduce object oriented programming's principles and basics such as abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance.

Different kinds of organisms are present on the board which represents the world.
The simulation part consists of simulating an action each organism takes each turn
(ie. animals move from one square to another; different kinds of organisms have different actions).
When a creature tries to move to a square occupied by another organism there's a fight and the stronger one survives.
There is also a user-controlled human on the board.
Each turn they can either move from one square to another or use a special ability.
The world can consist of either square fields or hexagons - this option is hardcoded.
The application also lets user either save or load game state.
